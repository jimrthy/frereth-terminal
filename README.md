# frereth-terminal

All great projects have some sort of command-line interface.

## Installation

Just don't even bother. This isn't even barely worthy of such pretension.

## Usage

FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar frereth-terminal-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.

Currently, there aren't any. Honestly, there probably never will be. I'm
just tinkering.

## Examples

...

### Bugs

Absolutely none yet. There aren't even any features that I haven't bothered
to document.
